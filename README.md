PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In this project, I am analyzing sales and product data to understand the overall business performance. The data includes information about different products, their categories, prices, discounts, quantities sold, and modes of payment. I have combined the data into one sheet for easier analysis and added calculated fields like total buying price, total selling price, profit, and extracted date components (day, month, year).

• The goal is to identify:
   •	Which products and categories generate the most profit
   •	How different sales types (online, retail, wholesale) are performing
   •	How payment methods and discounts affect the sales
   •	Monthly and yearly sales trends

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
I am doing this project to get meaningful insights from the business data. This helps me understand:
  •	Which areas of the business are doing well
  • Where there is room for improvement
  • How buying price and selling price affect profit
  •	What kind of products or categories people are buying more

This kind of analysis can help businesses make better decisions related to pricing, inventory, marketing, and customer engagement.
On a personal level, this project helps me improve my skills in data handling, Excel formulas, and dashboard creation — which are very useful in business analytics roles.
